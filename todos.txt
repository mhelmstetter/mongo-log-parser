Don't obfuscate the readPreference "tags" field, mode is unobfuscated
Display truncated in red if the sample query indicates it is truncated: "truncated":{"errMsg":{"size":99999,"type":"xxx"}
Can we freeze the column headers? Or maybe display a really small set of headers when the accordian is expanded?
When we obsfucate a regex, can we keep any regex metacharacters?
Can we break down the read preference by analytics vs. voting (tags?)
